Tea Cozy
Unit 4 - Final Project (to be reviewed)

First of all: Thanks for reviewing my code!
I had a lot of fun completing this project.

But I have some questions/suggestions regarding the original template:

- Why isn't there a h1 headline?
- In general I think headline tags are oddly chosen.
- In the "Tea"-section, why are the img subline <span> and not <p>?
- margins and paddings aren't consistent: e.g. Logo in <header> and copyright in <footer>

 These are certainly not major things, I just stumbled upon them while working on the project.

 Looking forward to your review - have a nice day,
 Francesca
